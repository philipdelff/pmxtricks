*** NMscanData
**** TODO check if .mod file exists
Right now it is assumed. But check for it. And if a new argument "dir.data" is
given, it is not needed. This is to be implemented in NMtransInput.
**** TODO Clean up messages
Messages seem a bit random.
**** DONE NMdata class
     CLOSED: [2019-12-14 Sat 22:29]

If recoverRows, do
***** take the not used lines from input data
***** [#B] What to do about id-level and occ-level variables?
They could differ from output, should they be overwritten then? I
really don't think so. But $id and $row are made before this, right? A
simple approach would be to do nothing but just rbind. We can then add
some tests and some warnings.
*** trapez
**** TODO Check for equal lengths of x and y
**** TODO Check if at least 2 observations (before looking for NAs)
**** DONE strategy for cumulative auc
     CLOSED: [2019-10-24 Thu 14:18]
One shorter than x and y. 
**** DONE Why not just pass the na.rm to sum/cumsum?
     CLOSED: [2019-10-24 Thu 14:19]
No, cumsum does not support na.rm
*** NMcompRes
If an rds exists but was called with other options, it is still
used. That is risky. Maybe save all options to function call in
object? Or compare with the meta data object?
*** NMtransInput
**** Check input file vs $INPUT
If renaming is being done, provide an overview of what is being
renamed. From such an overview, it should be very easy to see if it's
intentional.
*** canvasSize
**** DONE scale parameter
     CLOSED: [2020-04-13 Mon 16:53]
scale all dimensions by the parameter value in end of function.
*** ggwrite
*** TODO [#A] Message written paths to user
**** DONE Naming of multiple plots 
     CLOSED: [2021-04-28 Wed 19:04]
For list objects, optionally name the plots (when onefile=F) by the
element names of the list. Could also use an additional argument to
provide the name suffixes, but using element names reduces need for
checks of length, class etc.
*** NMplotBSV
**** TODO Default regex should match all ETA's

\usage{
mergeCheck(df1, df2, by, debug = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data.fram with the number of rows must should be obtained from
the merge. The resulting data.frame will be ordered like df1.}

\item{df2}{A data.frame that will be merged onto df1.}

\item{by}{The column(s) to merge by. Character string (vector). Must be
supplied.}

\item{debug}{Start by calling browser()?}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to merge. If all is among them, an
error will be returned.}
}
\value{
a data.frame resulting from merging df1 and df2
}
\description{
This function is a useful wrapper for merges where df1 will be extended with
columns from df2, i.e. all rows in df1 are retained, and no new rows can be
created. For this very common type of (simple) merges, mergeCheck does the
merge and ensures that exactly this happened.
}
\details{
Besides merging and checking rows, mergeCheck makes sure the order
    in df1 is retained in the resulting data. Also, a warning is given if
    column names are overlapping, making merge create new column names like
    col.x and col.y. Merges and other operations are done using
    data.table. If df1 is a data.frame (and not a data.table), it will
    internally be converted to a data.table, and the resulting data.table
    will be converted back to a data.frame before returning.

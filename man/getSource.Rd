\item{overwrite}{Owerwrite previously imported file?}

\item{source.directly}{Enables direct sourcing of the central file copy. This
bypasses the whole concept of the function but it is useful when
developing while using a function. Especially if your debugger in the
editor is linking to a file that you will edit while debugging. It gives
a warning because it is not recommended in final code.}

\item{silent}{Disables printning. Mainly used in testing.}

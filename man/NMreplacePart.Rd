\usage{
NMreplacePart(
  path,
  section,
  newlines,
  newpath,
  backup = T,
  blank.append = T,
  test = F,
  debug = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The run to edit. If a directory is given, the file is assumed to
be called input.txt in that folder.}

\item{section}{The name of the section to update. Example: section="EST" to
edit the sections starting by $EST. See NMgetSection}

\item{newlines}{The new text (including "$SECTION"). Better be broken into
lines in a character vector since this is simply written with
writeLines.}

\item{newpath}{path to new run. If missing, path is used. If NULL, output is
returned rather than written.}

\item{backup}{In case you are overwriting the old file, do you want to
backup the file (to say, backup_input.txt)?}

\item{blank.append}{Append a blank line to output?}

\item{test}{Want to see the resulting input.txt and not write it to disk?
Default is FALSE.}

\item{debug}{start by running browser()?}
}
\description{
Just give the section name, the new lines and the file path, and the
"$section", and the input to Nonmem will be updated.
}
\details{
The new file will be written with unix-style line endings.

\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset to plot.}

\item{run}{The main title of the plot. Called run becaus you often
want a Nonmem run name here.}

\item{x}{The name of the column to be plotted on the x-axis
(string).}

\item{dv}{The name of the column containing observations (string).}

\item{pred}{The name of the population predictions in data
(string).}

\item{ipred}{The name of the individual predictions in data
(string).}

\item{grp}{A grouping variable. Subjects will be split into groups
of common values (string).}

\item{amt}{The name of the column containing dose amounts. If this
argument is given, the doses will be included as vertical bars
in the plots, with a secondary axis representing the dose
amounts on the right.}

\item{id}{The name of the subject ID column}

\item{xlab}{label for x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{label for y-axis.}

\item{ylab2}{label for y-axis to the right representing dose
amounts.}

\item{scales}{passed to facet_wrap.}

\item{logy}{Show y-axis on logarithmic scale?}

\item{NPerSheet}{Number of subjects per sheet}

\item{LLOQ}{Lower limiit of quantification (will be shown as a
horizontal line in plots).}

\item{use.evid2}{Should EVID 2 records be used for pred and ipred
plotting? The default is to use EVID==2 records if data
contains a column called EVID, and this column has at least
one value equalling 2.}

\item{facet}{splits plots in pages}

\item{par.prof}{Distinguish multiple profiles in dataset.}

\item{x.inc}{Values that must be included in the span of the
x-axis. This can be multiple values, like c(5,1000).}

\item{grp.label}{Column to use for labeling the sheets (while
sorting by grp). A typical example is that grp is numeric (say
dose including 80 and 280) while grp.label is a character
(including 80 mg and 280 mg). In order to sort correctly, you
must use the numeric variable for grp. But in order to get
nice labels, use the character variable for labels.}

\item{labels}{The default is to include the subject id's in labels
above the plots (using facet_wrap()). Set this to FALSE to
remove these labels in order to have more space for the plots
themselves.}

\item{nullIfEmpty}{By default, submitting an empty data set in the
data argument will give an error. However, sometimes this may
be annoying. An example is a wrapper that runs over multiple
models splitting into subsets of data. Some models may not
contain all data, and then ggIndProfs would fail. If you want
it to return NULL and not an error in this case, use
nullIfEmpty=TRUE.}

\item{debug}{Start by calling debug()?}

\item{debug.sheet}{If something goes wrong when plotting, this may
be the debug method to use. Pass an integer to call browser()
when creating the corresponding sheet.}

\details{
The resulting plot object has been limited on x axis by
    coord_cartesian. So if you want to adjust x limits on the
    output from this function, you must use coord_cartesian. xlim
    does not work.

The resulting object can be saved with ggwrite.
